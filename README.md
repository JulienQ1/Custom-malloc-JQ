# Custom-malloc
## Command to initialize 

```console
$ make -B && ./heap
$ ./heap
```
## Project instruction
In this project, you will be implementing your own malloc(3), free(3), realloc(3) and calloc(3)  functions. The purpose of these functions is to allocate memory on the heap of a program. You will create these functions and use the same prototype as the one in libc. You re-implementation should be using the brk(2) and sbrk(2) system calls. https://linux.die.net/man/2/sbrk
